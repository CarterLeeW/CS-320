How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code is in the best condition, I follow best practices that include using the appropriate software design templates, useful comments, and naming conventions. I also created JUnit tests that verify the requirements for the software.
  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I try my best to center the program around fulfilling the user requirements in the most efficient way possible. I then use JUnit tests to reflect the user requirements and to check that the code satisties those requirements.

How do I approach designing software?

I read over the user needs and think of how the requirements can be met within the bounds of object-oriented programming. Then I decide which classes will be useful and the appropriate heirarchy. Then I can begin designing the functions and classes alongside JUnit tests to ensure that the program meets the requirements. I do my best to make my programs as simple as possible to improve readability and reduce bugs.
